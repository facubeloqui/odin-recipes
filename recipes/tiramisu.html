    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This delicious and unbelievably easy Tiramisu recipe is made with coffee soaked lady fingers, sweet and creamy mascarpone (no raw eggs!), and cocoa powder dusted on top. It requires no baking and can be made in advance!</p>
    <p>Who doesnt love an easy no-bake dessert?  Thats one of the best things about this tiramisu recipe.  If you are looking quick no-bake dessert I also love No Bake Peanut Butter Pretzel Bars and Butterscotch Cereal Bars.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ladyfingers:</strong> I buy them, but you could make them from scratch.</li>
        <li><strong>Mascarpone:</strong> It wouldnt be true tiramisu without mascarpone, but if you absolutely must, you could substitute cream cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Coffee:</strong> I use espresso</li>
        <li><strong>Heavy Whipped cream</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Granulated Sugar</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla extract:</strong> Or substitute imitation vanilla</li>
        <li><strong>Cocoa powder:</strong> For dusting on top</li>
    </ul>
